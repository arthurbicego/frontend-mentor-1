## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Some of my major learnings in this challenge was with CSS, such as: code optimization and class reusing, Flexbox centering properties, and avoid magic numbers.

Flexbox Centering Property:

```css
main {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In this challenge the main skills I identified that I need to improve is understand better the behavior of nested div and the Flexbox.
